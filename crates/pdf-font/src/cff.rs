//! Bare CFF font programs.
//!
//! `/FontFile3` may hold a bare CFF font program rather than a complete `OpenType` file.
//! A CFF carries no `cmap` table, so a character code reaches a glyph by a different route
//! than in a `TrueType` font, and that route is what this module supplies.
//!
//! # The two routes, and why the distinction matters
//!
//! A *name-keyed* CFF — what a PDF simple font embeds — names every glyph in its charset.
//! A character code becomes a glyph name (from the PDF `/Encoding`, or from the encoding
//! the font itself carries) and the name becomes a glyph index. A *CID-keyed* CFF — what a
//! composite font embeds — has no glyph names at all: its charset assigns a CID per glyph,
//! and a code reaches a glyph by inverting that.
//!
//! Confusing the two is not a harmless error. Treating a character code as a glyph index,
//! which is what happens when neither route is taken, loads without complaint and draws
//! the wrong glyphs — text that looks like text and says something else. That failure is
//! why [`crate::LoadedFont::glyph_for`] refuses to guess.
//!
//! # Why this module is thin
//!
//! Every byte-level structure involved — the INDEX and DICT encodings, charset formats 0,
//! 1 and 2, encoding formats 0 and 1 with their supplements, the String INDEX and Adobe's
//! 391 standard strings — is parsed by `read-fonts`, which `skrifa` already brings in and
//! which is fuzzed and memory-safe. Hand-rolling that parsing would mean writing exactly
//! the untrusted-input byte handling this project chose `skrifa` to avoid, and would mean
//! transcribing a 391-entry table by hand. See `doc/adr/0006-cff-through-read-fonts.md`.
//!
//! What is left here is the PDF-specific part: deciding *which* route applies, and putting
//! the results in a form the loader can use.
