//! Every page of the corpus, drawn by us and by three independent renderers.
//!
//! # What this gate is for, and how it differs from `corpus.rs`
//!
//! `corpus.rs` asks whether we *reported* everything we could not draw. This asks whether
//! what we did draw is *right*, which no amount of self-reporting can establish. The two
//! defects found in the fourth working session — every gradient mirrored about the page's
//! centre line, every image sampled through a doubled transform — sat on pages that
//! reported nothing wrong, on both backends at once, and would have been caught the first
//! time this ran.
//!
//! The oracle is [`pdfref`]'s triangulation rule: where two independent implementations
//! agree with each other and we differ from both, we are wrong. Where they disagree among
//! themselves there is no answer to hold us to, and the page is recorded rather than
//! failed. Principle 5 governs what happens next: a contradiction is a question to take
//! back to the specification, never a target to move towards. The value of this gate is
//! that it *finds the page*; it never says what the answer is.
//!
//! # Why the bound is relative to the references' own disagreement
//!
//! A fixed tolerance has to serve a page of flat fills, where the references agree to a
//! worst tile of 0.4, and a page of small text, where they disagree at 26 among
//! themselves. No single number separates signal from noise on both. So the references'
//! own spread on *that page* sets the bound — see [`pdfref::Judgement::CORPUS`] — and the
//! question asked is whether we are further from the consensus than the consensus is from
//! itself. On a spread sample of this corpus that distinction was the difference between
//! 15 pages outside the fixed bounds and the 8 among them that are genuinely contradicted.
//!
//! # What is compared
//!
//! Every page of all 974 pdf.js corpus documents, and page one of the 14 specification PDFs
//! in `doc/` — 1794 pages. The corpus files are there because each one broke a reader once
//! and the interesting page is not always the first; the specification PDFs are 1382 pages
//! of consistent typesetting from 14 files, where page 500 exercises what page 499 did. See
//! [`work_items`].
//!
//! # What is gated, and what is only recorded
//!
//! Only pages we claim to draw *completely*. A page whose interpretation reports an
//! unsupported font or an undecodable image is expected to differ from a renderer that
//! implements it, and listing all of them would drown the signal. Those pages are counted
//! and printed — the count is a rough measure of how much the missing features cost
//! visually — but they cannot fail this gate. `corpus.rs` owns them.
//!
//! # Running it
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --release -p pdf-model --test oracle -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Artefacts for every page that is not agreement — our render, each reference's, and a
//! difference heatmap — are kept under `<target>/tmp/oracle/<stem>/p<n>/` and named in the
//! output. Pages that agree have theirs deleted: five thousand PNGs of pages nobody will
//! look at is a gigabyte of evidence for nothing.

/// - `ghostscript`, `pdf/pdf_optcontent.c`, in `pdfi_oc_check_OCMD`: `WARNING: OCMD contains
///   VE, which is not supported (ignoring)`.
/// - `poppler` does implement it: the installed library exports
///   `OCGs::evalOCVisibilityExpr(Object const*, int) const` and carries the string
///   `Loop detected in optional content visibility expression`.
/// - `pdf.js` implements it too, and prefers it, in `src/core/evaluator_utils.js` — which is
///   in this repository, under `doc/pdf.js`. Its issue #12097 is closed by PR #13243, and
