//! ISO 32000-2 §12.8's digital signatures, as far as a program without a trust store can go.
//!
//! §12.8.1 divides the subject for us. Verifying a signature has two halves, and the clause
//! states them in order:
//!
//! > To verify the signature, an appropriate signature handler is required. … The signer's
//! > certificate shall be determined and verified by the signature handler to match with any of
//! > the validation parameters and other conditions. If the verification fails, the signature
//! > shall be considered invalid. The digest shall be recomputed and compared with the one stored
//! > in the document. Differences between the two indicates that modifications have been made
//! > since the document was signed and thus the signature shall be considered invalid.
//!
//! The first half — a certificate, a chain, a revocation check — is a public-key infrastructure
//! and a threat model, which §7.6.5's public-key security handlers are already refused for (ADR
//! 0031). The second half is a digest over bytes this program has in hand.
//!
//! # What is here: everything a signature says, and one thing it can be *checked* against
//!
//! [`Signature`] is Table 255. [`Permissions`] is §12.8.6's `/Perms` with §12.8.2.2's `/P`
//! level, which is what a document says may be changed without invalidating its author's
//! signature.
//!
//! And [`Signature::coverage`] is the check that needs no cryptography at all. §12.8.1 says what
//! a byte range digest covers:
//!
//! > This range should be the entire PDF file, including the signature dictionary but excluding
//! > the signature value itself (the Contents entry).
//!
//! A `/ByteRange` that stops short of the end of the file therefore names bytes **nobody signed**
//! — an incremental update appended after signing — and saying so costs one comparison against
//! the file's length. It is not a validity verdict and this module never calls it one: a
//! signature whose range covers everything may still be forged, and one that does not may be a
//! perfectly honest later revision. What it is, is the one statement about a signature that a
//! renderer can make on its own evidence.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! No digest is computed and no `/Contents` is parsed. Computing the digest would be honest and
//! useless without the certificate half — a hash that matches proves the bytes are the bytes the
//! *stored* hash was made from, and nothing about who made it — and it would invite a caller to
//! read "digest matches" as "signature valid", which is the failure mode this module is shaped
//! to avoid. 8 of the 974 corpus documents carry a `/ByteRange`, and 7 a signature dictionary.
