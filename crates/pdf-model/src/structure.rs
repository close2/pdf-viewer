//! ISO 32000-2 §14.7's logical structure, as far as a *reader* of content needs it.
//!
//! The structure tree says what a page's marks mean: this run of glyphs is a heading, that one
//! is a paragraph, this figure has a description. None of it changes a mark, which is why
//! §14.1 opens by saying the clause's features "do not affect the final appearance of a
//! document" — and why what this module exists for is the half that is *not* appearance.
//!
//! # The one question a content stream can ask
//!
//! A content stream cannot refer to a structure element: §14.7.5.4 says so and gives the
//! reason — "[b]ecause a stream cannot contain object references, there is no way for content
//! items that are marked-content sequences to refer directly back to their parent structure
//! elements". The standard's answer is the **structural parent tree**, a §7.9.7 number tree
//! keyed by the page's own `/StructParents`, whose value is an array indexed by
//! marked-content identifier.
//!
//! So a `BDC` carrying an `/MCID` can find its element in two lookups, and that is what this
//! module provides. It deliberately does not build the tree top-down: nothing here walks
//! `/K` from `/StructTreeRoot`, because no consumer in this program needs an *ordering* of
//! elements — §12.3.2.3's structure destinations read one element's own entries, and text
//! extraction asks about the element covering a sequence it is already inside.
